      <img src="assets/images/IMG_0013.jpg" alt="Nare Baghumyan">

      <p>I was born on December 7th, 1989 in Armenia.
        I studied at Yerevan Medical college where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry. 
        I have 10 years of experience working in the medical field and continue to pursue a higher education. 
        I am a self-motivated person who enjoys challenges and works well under pressure both as an individual and with others. 
        My personality strengths are my persistence and determination to see that I complete a task that I've set forth to do regardless of the complications.
        A weakness of mine would be my tendency of exhausting myself when setting on a course to complete my goals. </p>
